# bf2142-shaders
Shader Model 3_0 update for Battlefield 2142

Many changes derived from Project Reality's shader update

Todo:
- Cleanup and organize shader formatting for readability
- Learn more about HLSL and porting asm (especially vs_1_1 asm)
- Leverage `MAD` operations. Many `MUL + ADD` calculations found in shaders
- Support vs_3_0 and ps_3_0 if possible
- Use optimization techniques from https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018182/Low-Level-Thinking-in-High
